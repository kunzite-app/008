# 008 Event-driven AI powered Open Source Softphone

008 is an open-source event-driven AI powered WebRTC Softphone compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux.  
It is also accessible on the web (though official support for browser-related issues is not provided).

The name '008' or 'agent 008' reflects our ambition: beyond crafting the premier Open Source Softphone, we aim to introduce a programmable, event-driven AI agent. This agent utilizes embedded artificial intelligence models operating directly on the softphone, ensuring efficiency and reduced operational costs.

Here are the planned features [in our roadmap](https://github.com/DavidGOrtega/008/issues/1)

# Download

You can download the latest version from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

# Setup

This project is a WebRTC softphone, and communication is achieved via SIP over a socket. Leading PBX systems like Asterisk or Freeswitch support socket connections. If your provider does not offer this feature, consider using a SIP proxy such as Kamailio, Opensip or Routr.

## Configuration

The softphone is internally configured using a JSON definition (see details below). The configuration file can be loaded from either a server or a local file. 008 reads the file only once. To apply new settings, you must reload the configuration file as if it were new by clicking the green button in the configuration tab.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings -> Configuration (Gear Icon).
2. Fill in the 'Settings' input and 'Basic Auth' fields if needed.
3. Apply the changes by clicking the green button.

```json
{
  "sipUri": "sip:johndoe@example.com",
  "sipPassword": "securepass",
  "sipUser": "JohnDoe",
  "wsUri": "wss://example.com:8089/ws",
  "allowVideo": true,
  "allowTransfer": true,
  "allowBlindTransfer": true,
  "allowAutoanswer": false,
  "autoanswer": 5,
  "statuses": [
    { "value": "online", "text": "Online", "color": "#057e74" },
    { "value": "away", "text": "Away", "color": "#ff00ff" },
    { "value": "offline", "text": "Offline", "color": "#A9A9A9" }
  ],
  "numbers": [
    {
      "number": "+34917370224",
      "tags": ["Main"]
    },
    {
      "number": "+34917370225",
      "tags": ["Sec"]
    }
  ],
  "webhooks": [
    {
      "label": "mywebhook",
      "endpoint": "https://example.com/webhook"
    }
  ],
  "size": {
    "width": 360,
    "height": 500
  },
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
  "nickname": "John Doe" // used as Basic Auth user
}
```

### Quick test

Do you want to test it without having to install your SIP server? We have you covered!
Set `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunzite-app/008/master/packages/008/web/cfgDemo008.json` configuration.
Then, call the number `008`.

## Autoanswer

Autoanswer can be enabled via two options:

1.  Set `allowAutoanswer` to true and adjust `autoanswer` to the desired wait time (in seconds).
2.  Have the incoming request include the `X-Autoanswer` header with the desired wait time. This setting will override any prior setup.

## Numbers or Caller IDs

When these are specified under the field `numbers`, two fields `P-Asserted-Identity` and `X-Number` will be added to the SIP header.  
This helps identify the desired outgoing number or Caller ID in your PBX system.

# Events

One of the standout features is the event system. Every time an event is triggered, the corresponding data is dispatched to the designated webhooks or integrations in the configuration via a REST POST request.  
Most of these events also trigger the AI models that enhance the softphone in the Commercial version.  
Below, you'll find a detailed description of each event and sample payloads that you can expect at your endpoint.

<details>
  <summary>status:change</summary>

Triggered when the user changes the status within the settings.
:warning: This event does not determine the current phone network connectivity.

```json
{
  "type": "status:change",
  "data": {
    "status": "online",
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary> contact:click</summary>

Triggered when the contact link within the session screen is clicked. This link is available only if the contact can be found in the softphone's contacts.

```json
{
  "type": "phone:terminated",
  "data": {
    "contact": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "phones": ["+1223456869"]
    },
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>phone:ringing</summary>

Triggered after the call is emitted or received; this is determined by the `direction` field.

```json
{

  "data": {
    "cdr": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "direction": "inbound|outbound",
      "from": "extension1",

      "wait": 0,
      "total": 0,
      "duration": 0
    },
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>phone:accepted</summary>

Triggered once the call is accepted.

```json
{
  "type": "phone:ringing",
  "data": {
    "cdr": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "direction": "inbound|outbound",
      "from": "extension1",

}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>phone:terminated</summary>

  "type": "phone:terminated",
  "data": {
    "cdr": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "direction": "inbound|outbound",
      "from": "extension1",

    },
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>phone:recording</summary>

Triggered upon the recording is ready. It's sent as a base64 encoded webm file.

```json
{
  "type": "phone:recording",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid", // the call id
    "audio": {
      "blob": "base64 webm audio file"

  "data": {
    "id": "uuid", // the call id
    "segments": [
      {
        "channel": "remote|local",
        "start": 0,
        "end": 0,
        "text": ""
      }
    ],
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>phone:summarization</summary>

```json
{
  "type": "phone:summarization",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid", // the call id
    "summarization": "text",
    "context": {}
  }
}
```

</details>

### Context

All events come with a `context` field. This includes various account details that help identify who is sending the event, among other common settings:

```json
{
  "nickname": "John Doe",
  "sipUri": "sip:johndoe@example.com",
  "sipUser": "JohnDoe",
  "language": "en",
  "device": "default",
  "status": "online",
  "size": { "width": 360, "height": 500 }
}
```

### Retry

If the http call fails the softphone will try the request 5 times delaying the request gradually up to 2.5 minutes.
