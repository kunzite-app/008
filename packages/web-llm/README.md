# Web LLM

| [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mlc-ai/web-llm) | [Get Started](#get-started) | [Examples](examples) | [Documentation](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/docs/deploy/javascript.html) | [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) | [Discord][discord-url] |

WebLLM is a modular, customizable javascript package that directly
brings language model chats directly onto web browsers with hardware acceleration.
**Everything runs inside the browser with no server support and is accelerated with WebGPU.**
We can bring a lot of fun opportunities to build AI assistants for everyone and enable privacy while enjoying GPU acceleration.

**[Check out our demo webpage to try out!](https://webllm.mlc.ai/)**
You can use WebLLM as a base [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mlc-ai/web-llm) and build your own web application on top of it by following the [documentation](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/docs/deploy/javascript.html) and checking out [Get Started](#get-started).
This project is a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm),
which runs LLMs natively on iPhone and other native local environments.

## Get Started

WebLLM offers a minimalist and modular interface to access the chatbot in the browser.
The WebLLM package itself does not come with UI, and is designed in a
modular way to hook to any of the UI components. The following code snippet
demonstrate a simple example that generates a streaming response on a webpage.
You can check out [examples/get-started](examples/get-started/) to see the complete example.

```typescript
import * as webllm from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";

// We use label to intentionally keep it simple
function setLabel(id: string, text: string) {
  const label = document.getElementById(id);
  if (label == null) {
    throw Error("Cannot find label " + id);
  }
  label.innerText = text;
}

async function main() {
  // create a ChatModule,
  const chat = new webllm.ChatModule();
  // This callback allows us to report initialization progress
  chat.setInitProgressCallback((report: webllm.InitProgressReport) => {
    setLabel("init-label", report.text);
  });
  // You can also try out "RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1-q4f32_1"
  await chat.reload("Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-q4f32_1");

  const generateProgressCallback = (_step: number, message: string) => {
    setLabel("generate-label", message);
  };

  const prompt0 = "What is the capital of Canada?";
  setLabel("prompt-label", prompt0);
  const reply0 = await chat.generate(prompt0, generateProgressCallback);
  console.log(reply0);

  const prompt1 = "Can you write a poem about it?";
  setLabel("prompt-label", prompt1);
  const reply1 = await chat.generate(prompt1, generateProgressCallback);
  console.log(reply1);

  console.log(await chat.runtimeStatsText());
}

main();
```

### Using Web Worker

WebLLM comes with API support for WebWorker so you can hook
the generation process into a separate worker thread so that
the compute in the webworker won't disrupt the UI.

We first create a worker script that created a ChatModule and
hook it up to a handler that handles requests.

```typescript
// worker.ts
import { ChatWorkerHandler, ChatModule } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";

// Hookup a chat module to a worker handler
const chat = new ChatModule();
const handler = new ChatWorkerHandler(chat);
self.onmessage = (msg: MessageEvent) => {
  handler.onmessage(msg);
};
```

Then in the main logic, we create a `ChatWorkerClient` that
implements the same `ChatInterface`. The rest of the logic remains the same.

```typescript
// main.ts
import * as webllm from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";

async function main() {
  // Use a chat worker client instead of ChatModule here
  const chat = new webllm.ChatWorkerClient(
    new Worker(new URL("./worker.ts", import.meta.url), { type: "module" })
  );
  // everything else remains the same
}
```

### Build a ChatApp

You can find a complete
a complete chat app example in [examples/simple-chat](examples/simple-chat/).

## Customized Model Weights

WebLLM works as a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm).
It reuses the model artifact and builds flow of MLC LLM, please check out
[MLC LLM document](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/javascript.html)
on how to add new model weights and libraries to WebLLM.

Here, we go over the high-level idea. There are two elements of the WebLLM package that enables new models and weight variants.

- model_url: Contains a URL to model artifacts, such as weights and meta-data.
- model_lib_url: A URL to the web assembly library (i.e. wasm file) that contains the executables to accelerate the model computations.

Both are customizable in the WebLLM.

```typescript
async main() {
  const myLlamaUrl = "/url/to/my/llama";
  const appConfig = {
    "model_list": [
      {
        "model_url": myLlamaUrl,
        "local_id": "MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0"
        "model_lib_url": "/url/to/myllama3b.wasm",
      }
    ],
  };
  // override default
  const chatOpts = {
    "repetition_penalty": 1.01
  };

  const chat = new ChatModule();
  // load a prebuilt model
  // with a chat option override and app config
  // under the hood, it will load the model from myLlamaUrl
  // and cache it in the browser cache
  // The chat will also load the model library from "/url/to/myllama3b.wasm",
  // assuming that it is compatible to the model in myLlamaUrl.
  await chat.reload("MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0", chatOpts, appConfig);
}
```

In many cases, we only want to supply the model weight variant, but
not necessarily a new model (e.g. `NeuralHermes-Mistral` can reuse `Mistral`'s
model library; `WizardMath` can reuse `Llama-2`'s model library). For
an example of how a model library is shared by different model variants,
see `examples/simple-chat/src/gh-config.js`. We also provide
a plethora of prebuilt model libraries, including:

- `Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-q4f32_1`: Llama-7b models.
- `RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1-q4f32_1`: RedPajama-3B variants.
- `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-q4f16_1`: Mistral-7B variants.
- and many more at [binary-mlc-llm-libs](https://github.com/mlc-ai/binary-mlc-llm-libs).

## Use WebLLM Package

You can directly use WebLLM in your package via npm. Checkout instructions
in the following project

- [get-started](examples/get-started): minimum get started example.
- [web-worker](examples/web-worker): get started with web worker backed chat.
- [simple-chat](examples/simple-chat): a mininum and complete chat app.

## Build WebLLM Package From Source

NOTE: you don't need to build by yourself unless you would
like to change the WebLLM package, follow [use WebLLM](#use-web-llm-package) instead.

WebLLM package is a web runtime designed for [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm).

1. Install all the prerequisites for compilation:

   1. [emscripten](https://emscripten.org). It is an LLVM-based compiler that compiles C/C++ source code to WebAssembly.
      - Follow the [installation instruction](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions-using-the-emsdk-recommended) to install the latest emsdk.
      - Source `emsdk_env.sh` by `source path/to/emsdk_env.sh`, so that `emcc` is reachable from PATH and the command `emcc` works.
   2. Install jekyll by following the [official guides](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). It is the package we use for website. This is not needed if you're using nextjs (see next-simple-chat in the examples).
   3. Install jekyll-remote-theme by command. Try [gem mirror](https://gems.ruby-china.com/) if install blocked.
      `shell
    gem install jekyll-remote-theme
    `
      We can verify the successful installation by trying out `emcc` and `jekyll` in terminal, respectively.

2. Setup necessary environment

   Prepare all the necessary dependencies for web build:

   ```shell
   ./scripts/prep_deps.sh
   ```

3. Buld WebLLM Package

   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

4. Validate some of the sub-packages

   You can then go to the subfolders in [examples](examples) to validate some of the sub-packages.
   We use Parcelv2 for bundling. Although Parcel is not very good at tracking parent directory
   changes sometimes. When you make a change in the WebLLM package, try to edit the `package.json`
   of the subfolder and save it, which will trigger Parcel to rebuild.
